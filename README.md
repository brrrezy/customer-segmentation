# customer-segmentation

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to segment customers based on their behavior and demographic data using a **Keras-based neural network**. The aim is to classify or cluster customers into meaningful groups that businesses can target more effectively.

## 🚀 Overview

Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy that enables personalized engagement and better resource allocation. In this project, we use **deep learning with Keras** to build a segmentation model, trained on customer-related features like age, spending score, income, and more.
